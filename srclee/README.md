This sph is modified from Github Repository "sph_fluids"

The Boundary Force Model(Monaghan 1992) is added for SPHFEM, while in sph_fluids, Bonduary implementation is a rigid ball- wall collection model, which is not physical-based.

One more thing, the post-processing was done in Paraview by VTK XML, but directly running OpenGL
